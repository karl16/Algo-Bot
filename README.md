# Algo-Bot
Algorithmic trading bot utilizing the Robinhood API created by Karl Lawson (karl16) and Daniel Bunch (jdbunch).

# Auth.py
This is the token that you receive after logging in to your Robinhood account. Having it hardcoded means that you do not have to log in each time you run the program.

Having it in a different file makes it possible to ignore that file when uploading to github so others do not see your token.

# Stocks.txt
This is a list of the stocks that the bot will examine with one symbol per line.
